# gnu-linux-packaging

This repository stores documentation and code for the use cases I implement related to software packaging in various GNU/Linux distributions. The goal of the repository is to collect knowledge that will be useful as a reference in the future. Since I believe this information may also be useful to other people, I make it publicly accessible here. 

Use cases for RPM format:

- [01. Build a minimal RPM package](rpm/01-build-a-minimal-rpm-package)
